# CircularBuffer

A CircularBuffer (or ring buffer) is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure is useful for buffering data streams and implementing queue-like behavior in a fixed amount of memory.

## Features

- Fixed size buffer with efficient use of space.
- Supports circular wrap-around for continuous data writing.
- Thread-safe operations (if applicable).
- Useful for streaming data applications.

## Installation
